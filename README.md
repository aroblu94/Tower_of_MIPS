# Tower_of_MIPS
This is my project for university course in _Computer Architecture_.   
It's a solver of instances of the __Tower of Hanoi__ game written in `MIPS Assembly`.   
More about the original game [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi).   

This solver offers the possibility to choose starting and arrival's pegs.

You can try it using `spim` (or `QtSpim`: [http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/)).

For running, type in terminal  

    $ spim -file tower_of_mips.asm
